# Task 04 – US Accident Data Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of the US traffic accidents dataset. The goal is to extract patterns related to time of day, weather conditions, accident severity, and geographic trends using Python and data visualization techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `US_Accidents_March23.csv`, which includes records of traffic accidents with various features like location, timestamp, weather conditions, and severity.

## Key Tasks Performed
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset using pandas.
2. Converted time fields to datetime and extracted useful components like hour of day.
3. Visualized:
   - Accidents by time of day.
   - Top weather conditions for accidents.
   - Severity distribution.
   - Top 10 states with most accidents.
4. Provided insights and trends based on charts and observations.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook `Task04_US_Accident_Analysis.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Upload the `US_Accidents_March23.csv` file when prompted.
3. Run all cells to generate charts and analysis.

## Insights
- Peak accident hours: *Example: 4 PM – 7 PM*
- Weather conditions like rain and snow increase accident frequency.
- Certain states show higher accident counts.
